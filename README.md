# Alternative Racial Traits

A small mod to add alternative Racial Traits to Pathfinder: Kingmaker by [Owlcat Games](https://owlcatgames.com/)

The current version is barebones and only has a few Orc Racial Traits and no proper icons.

This mod is largely based on the work done by [Jenny Messerly](https://github.com/jennyem) with her mod [Eldritch Arcana](https://github.com/jennyem/pathfinder-mods)

## Currently implemented:

### Half-Orc

* **Bestial:** The orc blood of some half-orcs manifests in the form of particularly prominent orc features, exacerbating their bestial appearances but improving their already keen senses. They gain a +2 racial bonus on Perception checks. This racial trait replaces orc ferocity.
* **Burning Assurance:** Half-orcs acquire as a result of prejudice, and their self-confidence puts others at ease. Desert half-orcs with this racial trait gain a +2 racial bonus on Diplomacy checks. This replaces intimidating.
* **City-Raised:** Half-orcs with this trait know little of their orc ancestry and were raised among humans and other half-orcs in a large city. City-raised half-orcs are proficient with whips and longswords, and receive a +2 racial bonus on Knowledge (local) checks. This racial trait replaces weapon familiarity.
  * *Knowledge (local)* became *Knowledge (World)* and I replaced whips with \[Heavy] Flails as there are no whips in the game.
* **Hatred:** Half-orcs raised among orcs must prove themselves against their people’s enemies. Half-orcs with this racial trait gain a +1 racial bonus on attack rolls against humanoids of the dwarf, elf, and human subtypes because of their special training against these hated foes. This racial trait replaces intimidating and orc ferocity.
* **Sacred Tattoo:** Many half-orcs decorate themselves with tattoos, piercings, and ritual scarification, which they consider sacred markings. Half-orcs with this racial trait gain a +1 luck bonus on all saving throws. This racial trait replaces orc ferocity.
* **Shaman’s Apprentice:** Only the most stalwart survive the years of harsh treatment that an apprenticeship to an orc shaman entails. Half-orcs with this trait gain Endurance as a bonus feat. This racial trait replaces the intimidating trait.
* **Toothy:** Some half-orcs’ tusks are large and sharp, granting a bite attack. This is a primary natural attack that deals 1d4 points of piercing damage. This racial trait replaces orc ferocity.
