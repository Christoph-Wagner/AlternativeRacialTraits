# Alternative Racial Traits

A small mod to add alternative Racial Traits to Pathfinder: Kingmaker by [Owlcat Games](https://owlcatgames.com/)

The current version is barebones and only has a few Orc Racial Traits and no proper icons.

This mod is largely based on the work done by [Jenny Messerly](https://github.com/jennyem) with her mod [Eldritch Arcana](https://github.com/jennyem/pathfinder-mods)
